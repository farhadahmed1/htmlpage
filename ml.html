                <h5>About Coures</h5>
                <p>Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java—one of
                    the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system.
                    Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you
                    to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a
                    software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and
                    debugging your programs.</p>

                    </h5>
                    <p>A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll
                        in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start
                        with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically
                        subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause
                        your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your
                        course enrollments and your progress.</p>

                        project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization
                        includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of the other
                        courses before you can start it.</p>
